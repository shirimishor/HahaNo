# Haha No: A Hades II Mod

A small mod to add Poseidon Voicelines when the Sea Star boon **doesn't** proc (no reward duplication). There are 4 different voieclines chosen at random. The vanilla positive voicelines still trigger on success.

***Please note** that it means a Poseidon voiceline would trigger **every time** you collect a minor reward with Sea Star, so it may feel a bit excessive for some people.*


## Config Options
- `enabled` - enable/disable
- `classicOnly` - always trigger the voiceline "Hah-hah, no!" and not any of the other options.

## But where do these voicelines come from?
**Short answer:** From the base game.

**Long answer:** These voicelines are used in other sections of the game, specifically from the fishing minigame - when you fail to catch a fish while having Poseidon in the god pool. I used the ones that fit the Sea Star scenario.
